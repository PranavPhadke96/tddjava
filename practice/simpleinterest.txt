Problem Statement: Simple Interest Calculator

You are required to implement a Simple Interest Calculator that computes the simple interest earned on a loan or investment.

The system should meet the following requirements:

Normal Calculation - 
Use the formula of simple interest
​
Example: For a principal of 1000, rate of 5%, and time of 3 years, the interest should be 150.0.

Zero Principal Handling

If the principal is 0, the computed interest should always be 0.0 regardless of rate or time.

Invalid Input Handling

If a negative interest rate is provided, the calculator should throw an IllegalArgumentException.

Simplicity of Design

The implementation should be minimal and clear.

Development should follow the TDD cycle (Red → Green → Refactor).
