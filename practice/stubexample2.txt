Problem Statement 2: 
Write PaymentProcessor that adds a transaction fee to payments based on user's account type from an external dependency AccountTypeProvider. 
Write tests using a stub for AccountTypeProvider to simulate different account types. 
There is a 2 percent fee for premium accounts and a 5 percent fee for standard accounts.
Write test cases first for this and then the implementation.
