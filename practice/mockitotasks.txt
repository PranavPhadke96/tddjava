Pass 2 Problem Statement

Requirement:
Enhance the CustomerOnboardingService to support eligibility verification.

Given a customer with valid information, when eligibility is checked, the system should return "APPROVED" if the customer meets the criteria.

Use the external dependency EligibilityService to determine eligibility.

Write tests first, then implement checkEligibility(Customer customer) in the service.

Mockito methods to use:

when(...).thenReturn(...) → for stubbing the eligibility check.

verify(..., times(1)) → to ensure eligibilityService.checkEligibility(customer) was invoked exactly once.

Pass 3 Problem Statement

Requirement:
Extend the CustomerOnboardingService to support account creation with error handling.

Given an eligible customer attempting account creation, when the external AccountService is unavailable, the system should throw a custom ServiceUnavailableException.

Write tests first, then implement createAccount(Customer customer) in the service.

Mockito methods to use:

when(...).thenThrow(...) → to simulate the unavailable account service.

assertThrows(...) → to assert that the exception is thrown.

verify(..., times(1)) → to ensure accountService.createAccount(customer) was invoked exactly once.
