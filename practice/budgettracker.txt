Problem Statement: Budget Tracking System
Context

You are building a Budget Tracking System for a personal finance app.
The goal is to help users keep track of their expenses and get notified when they exceed their budget.

You will design and implement a BudgetTracker class that keeps track of a user’s total spending against a defined budget limit.

You must follow the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach — write the test cases first (RED), then write the minimal code to make them pass (GREEN), and finally refactor if needed.

Functional Requirements

Initialization

When a BudgetTracker is created, it should accept a budget limit (e.g., ₹100 or $100).

Add Expense

The system should allow adding expenses using a method addExpense(double amount).

The tracker should maintain a running total of all expenses.

Check Budget Status

The method isOverBudget() should return:

false if the total expenses are less than or equal to the budget limit.

true if the total expenses exceed the budget limit.

Remove Expense

The tracker should support removing an expense using a method removeExpense(double amount).

After removing an expense, the total should update accordingly.

If the total goes back below or equal to the limit, isOverBudget() should return false.
